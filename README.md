- Can update vehicle info, attach vehicle photo, and verify entry.
- Open requests older than 7 days auto-deleted; QR becomes invalid.
- QR code valid for same day only (unless Guest House booking).
- Tracks entry/exit counts per QR.
- Guest House QR valid until booking closure.
- Exit updates record with exit date/time.
- Non-Guest House QR codes expire next day; status set to Closed.
